# 🧬 Cancer Research Software Repository
A collection of tools for modeling cancer incidence, survival, biomarker selection, and risk prediction model development — designed to advance reproducible and data-driven cancer research.

## Contents
- [Projecting expected cancer cases](https://github.com/younghhk/expectedCases)

  Estimates expected cancer cases for a cohort using age-specific incidence and mortality rates. The package expands 5-year age-band counts into single-year ages, applies sex-specific rates, and simulates annual aging, incidence, and all-cause mortality.

  🔒 Access to this repository is currently limited to authorized collaborators until the program is fully verified.

- [SEER Cancer Data Analysis](https://github.com/younghhk/SEER)

  This repository provides R functions to compute Incidence-Based Mortality (IBM) rates and rate ratios.
The methods include adjustments for small-count bias and variance estimation, making them suitable for rare cancers and small populations.

- [Survival Analysis](https://github.com/younghhk/Survival-Analysis)
  - [1 Choosing the Time Scale and Handling Delayed Entry in Cox Models](https://github.com/younghhk/Survival-Analysis#sec-time-scale-delayed-entry)

    Demonstrates a complex survival analysis scenario, including time-scale selection and handling delayed entry in Cox models, using hypothetical data, statistical methods, and reproducible R code.
