# SEER Cancer Data Analysis

This repository provides example code and documentation for **SEER Cancer Registry data analysis**, focusing on **incidence-based mortality (IBM) rates**, **rate ratios**, and related survival analysis methods.

##  Features
- Functions to compute **incidence-based mortality rates** with small-count adjustments:
  - **Fay‚ÄìFeuer method** (recommended for rare events)  
  - **Tiwari‚Äôs modification** (alternative adjustment)  
- Functions to estimate **rate ratios** with variance estimates using the **delta method**  
- Example workflows demonstrating SEER-based analyses  

---

## Example Workflow

```r
# Load functions
source("IBM_functions.R")

# Example: Compute IBM rate and rate ratio
ibm_result <- compute_dsr_and_rr_for_subset(
  df,
  idx1 = which(df$Group == "Non-Hispanic White"),
  idx2 = which(df$Group == "Non-Hispanic Black"),
  label_group1 = "NHW",
  label_group2 = "NHB",
  subset_label = "Example Subset",
  ci_method = "fayfeuer"
)

print(ibm_result)
```
