## 1. SEER Cancer Data Analysis

This repository provides example code and documentation for **SEER Cancer Registry data analysis**, focusing on **incidence-based mortality (IBM) rates**, **rate ratios**, and related survival analysis methods.





###  Features
- Functions to compute **incidence-based mortality rates** with small-count adjustments:
  - **Fayâ€“Feuer method** (recommended for rare events)  
  - **Tiwariâ€™s modification** (alternative adjustment)  
- Functions to estimate **rate ratios** with variance estimates using the **delta method**  
- Example workflows demonstrating SEER-based analyses  



### Example Workflow

```r
```r
# Load functions
source("IBM.R")

# Install package if needed
install.packages("readxl")

# Load the library
library(readxl)

# Read the Excel file
df <- read_excel("age_adjusted_data_grace.xlsx")


# Define index sets for comparison:
# Example: ER-negative, Non-Hispanic White vs Non-Hispanic Black, age 30â€“54
idx1 <- which(df$ER == "Negative" &
                df$Race == "Non-Hispanic White" &
                df$age_group_strata == "30 - 54")

idx2 <- which(df$ER == "Negative" &
                df$Race == "Non-Hispanic Black" &
                df$age_group_strata == "30 - 54")

# Compute DSRs and rate ratio with Fayâ€“Feuer CI
compute_dsr_and_rr_for_subset(df, idx1, idx2,
                              "ER- & NHW & 30-54",
                              "ER- & NHB & 30-54",
                              "Subset",
                              ci_method = "fayfeuer")
```


###  Example 

An example SEER analysis is included:
