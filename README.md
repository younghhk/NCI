# 🧬 Cancer Research Software Repository
A collection of tools for modeling cancer incidence, survival, biomarker selection, and risk prediction model development — designed to advance reproducible and data-driven cancer research.

## Contents

- 🪢 [Mediation Analysis](https://github.com/younghhk/Mediation-Analysis)

  A workflow guide for planning mediation analysis in observational cancer research.  
This repository helps researchers identify the correct analytical framework based on study design — including outcome type, mediator dimensionality, and confounder structure — before model implementation.

  
- 📈 [Projecting Expected Cancer Cases](https://github.com/younghhk/expectedCases)

A tool for estimating expected cancer cases using age- and sex-specific incidence and mortality rates, providing an automated framework for cohort-based cancer projections.

  🔒 Access to this repository is currently limited to authorized collaborators until the program is fully verified.

- 🧮 [IBM-Calc: A Computational Tool for Estimating Age-Standardized Incidence-Based Mortality and Rate Ratio Confidence Intervals](https://github.com/younghhk/SEER)

  This repository provides R functions to compute age-adjusted Incidence-Based Mortality (IBM) rates and rate ratios.
The methods include adjustments for small-count bias and variance estimation, making them suitable for rare cancers and small populations.

- 📊 [Meta-Analysis for Clinical Research](https://github.com/younghhk/Meta-Analysis)

   This repository provides an overview, key concepts, and essential formulas for performing meta-analysis in clinical research, including fixed-effect and random-effects models.
